# Enhancing_the_Insurance_Experience_with_Machine_Learning_for_Premium_Prediction_and_No-Claim_Rewards
This project develops a Smart Insurance Recommendation System that predicts a customer’s Premium Range, Policy Type, and Vault Eligibility using machine learning classification models. The system applies optimized KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms, supported by thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. A user-friendly Streamlit web app allows real-time predictions based on customer attributes such as income, health, lifestyle, and credit score. This project aims to assist insurers in making faster, data-driven decisions with improved accuracy and efficiency.
